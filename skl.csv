"Skills
Ability to multi-task, react quickly to shifting priorities and meet deadlines. Solid web 
development experience using OOP, PHP, ASP NET C#, AJAX, MySQL, MS SQL, JavaScript, XML, 
HTML and CSS.
.NET (2.0/3.0/3.5/4.0)
I  have  been  working  in  .NET  for  several  years  now.  I  have  become  habituated  to  its 
methodologies and  feel  comfortable  developing  any  application.  I  have  developed  both 
desktop   and   web   based   applications,   using   VB.NET   /   C#   /   ASP.NET   languages.
PHP
I have an intimate knowledge of how to create web sites using PHP coding. I specialize in making 
web  sites,  web  services  and  web  applications  using  PHP  and  MySQL  databases  (or  NoSQL, 
Database cache  file),  these  are  web  sites  that  run  using  a  database  and  a  content  management 
system. The advantage of this is a web site that can perform an advanced function, e.g. booking 
system,  update  content  multi  language,  and  a  web  site  that  you  can  easily  update  on  a  regular 
basis.
Social APIs
Well-versed and easily can adapt any stander with RESTful OAuth-based social networking APIs: 
Twitter, Facebook API, Google map API/Youtube API, Disqus, Google+, Mail Chimp
SQL/PLSQL
Good working knowledge of SQL statements. I have extensive knowledge of creating and 
maintaining databases in Microsoft SQL Server and MYSQL, including creating users, roles, tables, 
indexes, stored procedures and setting permissions. I have knowledge of using simple and complex 
SQL statements, both DDL and DML. Having been interested in the performance tuning aspects of 
MS-SQL I have learned a great deal on how to optimization databases and related code. I have 
also briefly used Oracle and MySQL.
HTML / CSS / JavaScript / VBScript / AJAX
I have built several websites over the past years and also continue to build them in the .NET, PHP 
environment. am a proficient coder of HTML and like to stick to using W3C compliant code. 
Although I tend to avoid client side code, I use JavaScript especially with the revival of AJAX. As 
well as using the Microsoft AJAX component library I also use custom JavaScript to connect to web 
services for asynchronous interaction. More recently I have started working with Silverlight via RIA 
Services, although this is not a preferred development tool.
SOA/Web services/WCF
I have built SOA applications using WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) for use with AJAX 
client-side cod and also secured for business to business communications. I have used WCF data 
contracts to serialize proprietary classes and have also used XML serialization for transferring 
binary files between servers. I now feel proficient at creating SOA applications using WCF.
N-Tier Architecture
After discovering the benefits of n-tier architecture several years ago I have progressed my own 
architecture code base through several stages and have finally reached a highly robust, scalable 
and easy to implement de-coupled n-tier architecture which I have written in C# with templates 
for Code Smith.
C++ / Visual C++
C++ was essentially my first language and is where I retain my object oriented roots. I used it 
mostly in my final year project at University, where I used Microsoft Visual C++ and the Win32 API 
to create a GUI application using Win32 API.
Visual Basic
I used Visual Basic predominantly throughout my college studies. I have developed many 
applications/utilities in this language, such as a remake of the TV game show ‘Who Wants to be a 
Millionaire’, a chat server relay application and a multimedia file browsing utility.
ASP
I have used classic ASP for several websites before the dawn of ASP.NET. I have made a photo 
gallery site for my personal use, as well as a dynamic credit/debit card payment system.

RxJS, LoDash, Babel (ES2015), 
Monet, ESLint, D3js...

package managers like NPM, 
Composer...
Database: have used MongoDB, 
ElasticSearch as well as relational 
DB such as MSSQL, MySQL
Less / Sass / PostCSS: all have 
been used, with Sass being the 
most extensive. My CSS guideline is BEM methodology.
Grunt / Gulp / Webpack /

Business Analyst
My experience as a Business Analyst comes in two flavors: direct customer solutions based on specific customer needs; 
and commercialized off-the-shelf product evolution based on business concentration and audience. Customer specific 
solutions required understanding of the problem, providing potential solutions, working with remote staff to execute the 
project and delivery, both remotely and onsite. Commercial off-the-shelf solutions required understanding of the base 
platform, research elements (including surveys and external white papers) and customer interactions through variety of 
forums including blogs, forums and support tickets.
E-Commerce Development
Participated in building and maturing the company’s e-commerce site, selling over 60 products and applications to

With a very fundamental knowledge about Math and later in Logic and Computing I could catch up
with the new technologies not too difficult. And also develop the software systems with high quality in
terms of design and implementation. OOAD and Design Patterns are being used as those
advantages always to produce high quality software systems. I often work as the technical architect
and support for the whole team to gain the strong foundation for any projects I worked with. Always
helping team members to catch up and implement using better approach to eliminate bugs in the
system.
After a long time working in production professional environments I gained a lot of experiences not in
researching methodologies but production process. And almost my working time I took lead role so I
know how to build a team; how to manage and run it. I regularly lead to build teamwork
methodologies to gain the most efficient working results and satisfy clients’ needs. With my

These include AP, AR, Order entry, inventory control, cost accounting, payroll, and fixed assets accounting. These modules are ledgers themselves. We call them sub ledgers. Each contains the detailed entries of its specific field, such as accounts receivable. The sub ledgers summarize the entries, and then send the summary up to the general ledger.

"* Here are some problems that I met when developing in web application environment:
1. Some problems relating to page life cycle and postback data.
     + Problem 1 : 
         - Description : How can we save user's selection on UI, which were dynamically created, when viewstate is disabled in the whole website?
         - Solution : It is mandatory that server controls are created dynamically at the Page_Init stage, and we can get what user has selected at Page_Load or since then.
     + Problem 2:
         - Description : How can the GridView , which supports paging, save its page index when viewstate is disabled?
         - Solution : Using a session variable to save page index when there is an paging selected event occurred.. And then, with that session variable, we assign back to the GridView index at Page_Init stage.
     + Problem 3:
        - Description : How can we get data of what user has updated on server controls when there is a postback?
        - Solution : Using Request.Form with the index is the UniqueID of server control to get data of the current request.
     + Problem 4:
        - Description : How can a widget display its own language instead of the portal's language containing it?
        - Solution : Using methods of ResourceManager class and Resgen tool of .NET to convert *.resx files to *.Resources files.
2. Some problems about the performance: with web application, we should distinguish the processing between client side and server side. 
        - As regards client side, we use javascript to handle the event instead of server side followed by postback event wasting much time.
        - For server side, we should use session variables to store data, which is retrieved from the database, when necessary.        
b.      Web services:
* I have the opportunity to use WCF of .NET 3.5(Window Communication Foundation) to implement web services for web application.
* Here are some experiences when implementing web services for our web platform.
    + Problem 1 : 
      - Description : How to improve the perfomance when using web services internally(among the projects in the same solution)?
      - Solution : Using ""Add Reference"" instead of ""Add Service Reference"". This means that web services are called through dlls when used internally instead of through *.svc file with POX endpoint method.
c.       Multi-threading:
 * Some problems when using multi-threading:
   + Problem 1:  
      - Description : How to resolve the issue when there are more than one thread accessing to the same resources?
      - Solution : using lock or semaphore to make sure that one time the resource is used by only one thread. Another thread can access to the resource as the current thread has finished.
   + Problem 2:
      - Description : How to send a large file, for example 20MB without making the application slow-running?
      - Solution : Using another thread instead of the main thread of application.
d.      GDI:
                  * Nowadays, GDI+ is more commonly used than GDI because we do not care about the details of drivers of device. GDI+ provides APIs supporting this.
                  * I do not remember much about the details of GDI classes because it was used when I still studied in university. However, I think it is easy to be investigated because at least I had got one application like mspaint of Microsoft at university.    
e.      Interoperating with Unmanaged Code:
                  * I used to use C# to call TAPI(Telephony API) to make the phone call when making the application on windows mobile.
2.       C# - Visual Studio 2005 or 2008:
                  * I have C# and Visual Studio in most of projects. With C#, we can write application easily and quickly but unable to access to the low level programming. In this case, we use interoperating with C or C++ dlls.
                  * Visual Studio 2008 supports editing the database while VS 2005 does not have this capability.

the studies at Delft and during the stage in Ohio we got various
courses on oral and written presentation. These techniques were put into practice in teamworks.
Moreover, I've had various parttime
jobs like working in a supermarket and as cashier at a
gasstation,
in which I was always in close contact with clients.
Organizational capabilities and
competences
Capacity to organize and give directions In
recent job experiences I had to take the role of
“Software Development Leader” in various projects. More back in time, during my parttime
job
experience at the supermarket I had to organise the work of 10 to 20 people. I also had some
experience being the coach of a football (soccer) team of 15/16 year old “kids”.
Hobbies and interests My first and foremost hobby is being a father to 3 children, whom require much attention. I like
doing activities with the children and my wife.
I also like to do small programming projects in my spare time, like writing scripts to automate my
home PC or learning to program for Android.
Lastly, I love playing football (soccer).","""SKL""","""Capacities and personal abilities"""
